## Overview
Our Fund Manager is a decentralized platform that allows users to create and invest in tokenized funds. Leveraging Flare’s FTSO for real-time price feeds and FDC for transaction verification, our platform ensures a seamless, trustless, and transparent way to invest in diversified digital asset portfolios.

## Features

- Fund Creation: Users can create and manage funds with customized token allocations.

- FTSO Price Feeds: Only tokens supported by Flare’s FTSO are available, ensuring accurate pricing.
 
- Investor Participation: Others can invest in funds, gaining exposure to curated asset allocations.

- Fund Manager Rewards: Fund creators earn fees from investors for managing funds.
 
- Risk-Based Funds: Investors can choose from high-risk, balanced, or stable funds.
 
- FDC Verification: Transactions are verified using Flare Data Connector for enhanced security.

- Wrapped Token Mechanism: Investors receive WFLR tokens when purchasing fund shares, ensuring liquidity and enabling seamless trading.


## How It Works

- Create a Fund: Define the token allocation (e.g., 40% BTC, 60% ETH) from supported FTSO assets.

- Invest in a Fund: Investors can buy fund shares using supported assets, receiving wrapped tokens (WFLR) in return.

- Monitor and Earn: Fund managers earn fees from investments, while investors track fund performance.
 
- Exit a Fund: Investors can sell their fund shares in exchange for their proportional holdings.
