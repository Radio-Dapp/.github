## Overview
Our Fund Manager is a decentralized platform that allows users to create and invest in tokenized funds. Leveraging Flare’s FTSO for real-time price feeds and FDC for transaction verification, our platform ensures a seamless, trustless, and transparent way to invest in diversified digital asset portfolios.

## Features

- Fund Creation: Users can create and manage funds with customized token allocations.

- FTSO Price Feeds: Only tokens supported by Flare’s FTSO are available, ensuring accurate pricing.
 
- Investor Participation: Others can invest in funds, gaining exposure to curated asset allocations.

- Fund Manager Rewards: Fund creators earn fees from investors for managing funds.
 
- Risk-Based Funds: Investors can choose from high-risk, balanced, or stable funds.
 
- FDC Verification: Transactions are verified using Flare Data Connector for enhanced security.


> FTSO gives us prices for each asset on chain allowing us to calculate  the “cost” of each token

## How It Works

- Create a Fund: Define the token allocation (e.g., 40% BTC, 60% ETH) from supported FTSO assets.

- Monitor and Earn: Fund managers earn fees from investments, while investors track fund performance.
 
- Exit a Fund: Investors can sell their fund shares in exchange for their proportional holdings



# Developing on flare
Building on Flare was a great experience, especially as our idea kept evolving. The flexibility of the ecosystem allowed us to adapt quickly, and SparkDEX on Flare played a crucial role in shaping our approach by providing leverage functionalities that enhanced our solution. We also explored Flare Data Connector (FDC), which made it incredibly easy to fetch EVM transaction data from any chain, streamlining cross-chain interactions. This saved us significant development time and allowed us to focus on refining our core logic rather than dealing with data retrieval complexities. Overall, Flare provided the right tools and infrastructure to support our project’s dynamic nature, making cross-chain and DeFi development much more efficient.
