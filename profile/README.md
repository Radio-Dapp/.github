## Overview
Our Fund Manager is a decentralized platform that allows users to create and invest in tokenized funds. Leveraging Flare’s FTSO for real-time price feeds and FDC for transaction verification, our platform ensures a seamless, trustless, and transparent way to invest in diversified digital asset portfolios.

## Features

- Fund Creation: Users can create and manage funds with customized token allocations.

- FTSO Price Feeds: Only tokens supported by Flare’s FTSO are available, ensuring accurate pricing.
 
- Investor Participation: Others can invest in funds, gaining exposure to curated asset allocations.

- Fund Manager Rewards: Fund creators earn fees from investors for managing funds.
 
- Risk-Based Funds: Investors can choose from high-risk, balanced, or stable funds.
 
- FDC Verification: Transactions are verified using Flare Data Connector for enhanced security.


> FTSO gives us prices for each asset on chain allowing us to calculate  the “cost” of each token
